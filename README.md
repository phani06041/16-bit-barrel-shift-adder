16 bit barrel shit adder 
The basic operation of the desired barrel shifter is based on logarithmic shifter architecture as described in [1, p. 596] with additional right shift and rotate capabilities [10]. It can shift/ rotate 16-bit input data from 0 to 15 bits to the left/right, and send the result to the output.
